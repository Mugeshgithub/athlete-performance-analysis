**Seasonal and Gender-Based Analysis of Athlete Performance in Races

This project focuses on analyzing athlete performance data across various seasons, genders, and race lengths. The objective is to uncover insights about how these factors influence race results, particularly in 50km and 50mi races.

Project Overview
	•	Goal: To analyze the effect of season and gender on athlete performance in races.
	•	Key Insights:
	•	Performance varies across different seasons.
	•	Gender-based performance differences were explored.
	•	Age and race length impact athlete speeds.

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
	•	Plotly & Seaborn: For data visualization and statistical analysis.
	•	Matplotlib: For additional charting and plotting.

InstallationDependencies
	•	pandas
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	plotly

Usage
	1.	Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
	2.	Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
	3.	Generate visualizations to analyze:
	•	Seasonal performance trends.
	•	Gender-based performance analysis.
	•	Race length and age correlation.

Run the following command to generate the analysis and visualizations:
